#BeRoomers
 Based on the Users Nationality and Destination are there any patterns in the Users behavior? 

##Goals:

understand how seasonality affects the business and whether the behavior of the 

users differ based on the month of sign up. 

understand if the destination city affects this trend in any way to know whether the 

inventory available in each city has an impact on these figures.

## User Behavior is defined by:

1. How many times they visit the website;

2. For how long they use BeRoomers service; 

##Questions to be answered

  Do students from different nationalities act similarly when searching for rooms?

   I. Does that behavior differ depending on the Destination City? 

   II. Does the month of sign up define how the students behave later on?
